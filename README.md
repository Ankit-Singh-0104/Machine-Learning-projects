💼 PayPredict AI
Intelligent B2B Invoice Payment Forecasting & Management System
🧾 Introduction
In the B2B world, companies often operate on credit—goods or services are delivered, and invoices are issued with a payment due date. These unpaid invoices form the Accounts Receivable (AR).

In reality, clients often delay payments, disrupting cash flow and business operations.
PayPredict AI addresses this problem using a machine learning model embedded in a full-stack invoice management application.
